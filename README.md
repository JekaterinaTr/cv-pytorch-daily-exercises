# Computer Vision Daily Practice (OpenCV + PyTorch)

This repository documents my **daily, structured practice** in **Computer Vision and Deep Learning**, combining **OpenCV**, **PyTorch**, and supporting libraries.  
The goal is to build **strong fundamentals**, **real-world workflows**, and a **clean Git history** through consistent, small exercises.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Master computer vision fundamentals (image processing, video, features)
- Build deep learning pipelines using PyTorch
- Practice professional Git workflows (small commits, clear history)
- Create a portfolio-ready repository showing real progress

---

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

- 10–15 minutes per day
- One concept at a time
- Learn by experimenting (**Jupyter Notebooks**), then refactoring into clean **Python scripts**
- Every day ends with a **Git commit**
